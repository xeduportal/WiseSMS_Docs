### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is photo sharing really OFF by default?**
A: Yes! For child accounts, camera and gallery access within the app are completely disabled until a parent explicitly enables them in settings.

**Q: How does the unknown sender protection work?**
A: Children only receive messages from contacts on their parent-approved whitelist. Messages from unknown numbers are automatically blocked until approved by a carer.

**Q: How do I change settings?**
A: Parents receive an SMS access code on their phone. Enter this code on the child's device to unlock parental controls, then adjust any settings you need. This ensures secure access even when you're not together.

**Q: Why use SMS codes instead of remote management?**
A: SMS codes provide better security - your child can't accidentally change settings, and you maintain control even without a parent account or cloud service. Each code is unique, ensuring only you can access parental controls.

**Q: Are images really processed on-device?**
A: Absolutely. ALL image safety checks happen entirely on your device using local AI models. No images are ever uploaded to servers. But remember, image models make mistakes and so having open chats with your child about their app use and any images or messages is better.

**Q: How does the AI chat work?**
A: The AI chat is a chatbot powered by Google Gemini that children can message. It answers questions and can search the web for information, and has conversations—all without needing a browser! Parents set the child's age to ensure age-appropriate responses and control when children can access it.

**Q: Can kids really search the web without a browser?**
A: Yes! The AI chat can search the web to answer questions, but unlike a browser, it provides curated, age-appropriate information based on the age you've set. Kids get the information they need without the risks of unsupervised web browsing, pop-ups, inappropriate content, or endless clicking through websites.

**Q: How does message translation work?**
A: Simply swipe on any incoming message to instantly see it translated to your language. It's a quick gesture that makes multilingual conversations effortless.

**Q: What's included in Premium?**
A: Premium unlocks unlimited AI chat conversations, unlimited photo sharing, and advanced theme customization including animated emoji themes, AI-powered theme generation, and setting gallery photos as chat backgrounds. Free users get limited AI chats and photo sharing per day.

**Q: Can I create my own themes?**
A: Yes! Free users can choose from 8 beautiful themes and can edit a couple of key theme colors. Premium users can create unlimited custom themes from photos, use AI to generate theme backgrounds, and set any gallery photo as their chat background.

**Q: What languages are supported for translation?**
A: Swipe-to-translate supports eight languages through Google Translate. The AI can also transform messages into fun styles like Australian English and Pirate or surfer speak!

**Q: How do I set up Wind Down mode?**
A: In parental controls, set time windows when chat is restricted. Perfect for homework time, dinner, or bedtime.

**Q: Is the app suitable for very young children?**
A: Yes! With full parental controls and photo sharing disabled, it's safe for children as young as 8 to use for messaging family members.

**Q: What's free and what requires Premium?**
A: **Free Forever:** SMS/MMS messaging, parental controls, on-device image safety, contact whitelisting, message translation, Wind Down mode, 8+ themes, and limited AI chat & photo sharing per day. **Premium:** Unlimited AI chat, unlimited photo sharing, additional themes, and advanced theme customization (AI-generated backgrounds, gallery photos as backgrounds).
